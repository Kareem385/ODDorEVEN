ODDorEVEN
=========
Algorithm :

For finding Even or an Odd number in Java (using user input) we should have to calculate and write an algorithm for any *n* number 
The simple concept behind this program is to check weather the number is divisible by 2 or not.
If yes then this will be Even number and if not then it will be an Odd number

let's take an example:

Suppose we have a number = 2020,
if we do 2020 divided by 2 and remainder is 0 then it is an odd number.
2020 %(modulo) 2 == 0

TRUE -> Even number
